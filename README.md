# Experience ATMs for MineClone 2/5

Adds Experience "Bank Accounts" to MineClone 2.

Why does this exist?
--------------------
In Mineclone 2/5, it takes a while to gain the xp needed to do things like enchant, but its very easy to loose that xp when you die, either intentionally, or because of other players or hostile mobs. This allows you to keep any xp you put into your account safe for later use.
